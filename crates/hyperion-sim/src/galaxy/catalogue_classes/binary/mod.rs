//! Plan 11's binary catalogue classes (plan 11, P11.T8): hosts of interacting binaries carved out
//! of the cells and placed on class grids of their own under the `111` prefix.
//!
//! The grid redraws every binary that falls into one of plan 11's carved classes (P11.T7,
//! [`carved_class`](crate::stellar::binary::carved_class)), so the catalogue holds them, each class
//! with its own [`ClassProcess`](super::ClassProcess): a bound from its row of the share table, a
//! candidate drawn present first through a
//! [`ClassSampler`](crate::stellar::binary::sampler::ClassSampler), its scan marks before the rest
//! (`stellar::binary::scan`), a timeline from its marks, and the test that the grid applies
//! too. Built so far: the accreting white dwarfs, fast and slow
//! (P11.T8.a, [`AccretingWdFast`], [`AccretingWdSlow`]). The X-ray binaries and the two merger
//! classes follow in P11.T8.b–d.
