//! Plan 11's binary tables (P11.T6–T8): their shapes are plan 11's, their contents plan 15's
//! (P15.T9.b, P15.T10.b), which P11.T15 swaps in with a version bump.
//!
//! @provisional: hand-made scratch values (plan 11, Design note 13), not written by
//! `hyperion-fit`, so not in [`MANIFEST`](super::MANIFEST) until plan 15's task for them exists.
//! since-generator-version: 16 (the batch that lands P11.T7)
//! source: the brainstorm's counts at Milky Way parameters (plan 11, P11.T7): 9 × 10⁶ accreting
//!   white dwarfs (Pala et al. 2020, MNRAS 494, 3799; the brainstorm's 6–12 × 10⁶, split in
//!   halves by design note 12), 10⁴ X-ray binaries (Corral-Santana et al. 2016, A&A 587, A61),
//!   9 × 10⁴ stellar mergers in the source horizon (0.35 a year, Kochanek et al. 2014, MNRAS 443,
//!   1319, × 264,144 years) and 10 neutron-star mergers
//!
//! [`CLASS_SHARES`] (P11.T7) is the share matrix's row for each carved class: how many hosts a
//! solar mass formed makes, by population, and which layer gives each host up. Plan 09's
//! [`FeatureShares::set_class_shares`](crate::galaxy::features::shares::FeatureShares::set_class_shares)
//! folds it into the field factor, so that the grid, which redraws every binary that falls into a
//! class ([`SystemStars::generate`](crate::stellar::system::SystemStars::generate)), gives up
//! exactly what P11.T8's catalogue classes hold.
//!
//! **Scratch.** Every population makes the same hosts per solar mass formed, scaled so that the
//! Milky Way fixture's formed mass ([`MILKY_WAY_FORMED_MASS`]) gives the counts above, and each
//! class's layers are a guess from the stars that make it: an accreting white dwarf's primary is
//! its white dwarf's progenitor, 0.75–8 M☉; an X-ray binary's and a neutron-star merger's is the
//! first compact star's, 8 M☉ and up; a stellar merger's is spread over the layers with most of it
//! in C, where the contact binaries of W Ursae Majoris type lie. Plan 15's P15.T10.b fits them
//! against the engine.
