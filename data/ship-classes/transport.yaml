# Lore and flavor
lore: >-
  Transports are the vessels that move humanity between worlds, carrying colonists,
  military personnel, workers, and travelers across the vast distances of space. Unlike
  cargo freighters that move goods or combat vessels that project power, transports'
  precious cargo is people—each with hopes, fears, and destinations that will shape
  their lives.
  
  The transport's design reflects the responsibility of carrying human life. Redundant
  life support systems, extensive medical facilities, and comfortable quarters for
  long voyages are standard. Emergency escape pods, hull reinforcement, and defensive
  capabilities ensure passenger safety even in dangerous situations. Military transports
  add armor and point defense systems, allowing them to deliver troops into contested
  zones.
  
  Transport crews develop strong service orientations, viewing their passengers as guests
  to be protected and cared for. The best transport captains balance efficiency with
  compassion, knowing that for many passengers, this journey represents a major life
  transition. Stories abound of transport crews going above and beyond—delaying departures
  for late arrivals, organizing impromptu celebrations, and providing comfort during
  emergencies.
