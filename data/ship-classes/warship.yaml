# Lore and flavor
lore: >-
  Warships are purpose-built killing machines, large vessels optimized for close-range
  combat where their devastating firepower can be brought to bear. Unlike destroyers that
  engage at standoff range or dreadnoughts that dominate through sheer size, warships
  are designed to close with the enemy and engage in brutal, decisive combat at ranges
  measured in kilometers rather than thousands of kilometers.
  
  The warship's tactical doctrine is aggressive and unforgiving. Using warp jumps to
  bypass enemy defensive zones, warships appear at point-blank range where their heavy
  armor and overwhelming short-range firepower give them decisive advantages. This
  requires courage verging on recklessness—warship captains must be willing to commit
  fully, knowing that once engaged, retreat is rarely an option.
  
  Warship crews are the shock troops of naval warfare, trained for intense, chaotic
  close-quarters battle. The acceleration forces during combat maneuvers, the hull
  impacts from enemy fire, and the thunderous discharge of main batteries create an
  environment of controlled chaos. The best warship crews thrive in this maelstrom,
  maintaining discipline and coordination while their ship tears through enemy formations.
