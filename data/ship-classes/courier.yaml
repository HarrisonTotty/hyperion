# Lore and flavor
lore: >-
  Couriers are the lifelines of interstellar civilization, racing through space carrying
  critical communications, time-sensitive cargo, and irreplaceable materials. In an age
  where quantum entanglement communication is expensive and limited, couriers bridge the
  gap, ensuring that messages, data cores, and vital supplies reach their destinations
  quickly and securely.
  
  The courier's design philosophy balances speed with security. Their cargo holds feature
  advanced encryption, tamper-detection, and self-destruct systems to protect sensitive
  materials. Meanwhile, their powerful drives and efficient fuel systems allow them to
  maintain high speeds over long distances, often outrunning potential threats rather
  than engaging them.
  
  Courier crews are an elite breed—navigators who can plot optimal routes through hostile
  space, pilots who can execute emergency maneuvers, and security specialists trained to
  protect their cargo at all costs. Many famous explorers and scouts began their careers
  as courier pilots, learning to navigate dangerous routes and think independently during
  long solo runs.
