# Faction-specific manufacturers and variants
manufacturers:
  terran-federation:
    manufacturer: "Cape Canaveral Strategic Systems"
    variant: "Arsenal-class"
    lore: >-
      Federation Hyperions are sophisticated missile platforms designed for coordinated
      long-range strikes. Their fire control systems can manage hundreds of missiles
      simultaneously, overwhelming enemy defenses through sheer volume of fire.
  
  mars-coalition:
    manufacturer: "Olympus Missile Works"
    variant: "Salvo-class"
    lore: >-
      Martian Hyperions emphasize alpha strike capability, loading their magazines with
      the most powerful missiles available. Their doctrine centers on devastating opening
      volleys that can cripple enemy formations before they can respond.
  
  belt-alliance:
    manufacturer: "Hygiea Ordnance Collective"
    variant: "Launcher-class"
    lore: >-
      Belt Hyperions are economical missile carriers built around simple but reliable
      launch systems. Their massive magazines compensate for less sophisticated guidance,
      relying on quantity over individual missile quality.
  
  europa-compact:
    manufacturer: "Thrace Weapons Systems"
    variant: "Swarm-class"
    lore: >-
      Europan Hyperions deploy unique adaptive missiles that can coordinate mid-flight,
      forming intelligent swarms that adapt to enemy countermeasures. Their biomimetic
      targeting algorithms make their missiles exceptionally difficult to intercept.
  
  outer-rim-collective:
    manufacturer: "Rimward Munitions Guild"
    variant: "Rocketsled-class"
    lore: >-
      Outer Rim Hyperions are converted freighters and industrial vessels refitted with
      missile tubes. While lacking military polish, their massive cargo holds allow for
      unprecedented ammunition capacity.
  
  corporate-syndicate:
    manufacturer: "Raytheon Space Defense"
    variant: "ROI Maximizer-class"
    lore: >-
      Corporate Hyperions are designed around cost-per-missile-launched metrics,
      optimizing magazine capacity and reload efficiency. Their standardized munitions
      and automated systems minimize crew requirements.

# Lore and flavor
lore: >-
  Hyperion-class vessels represent the pinnacle of missile warfare doctrine—large ships
  built around massive missile magazines and sophisticated fire control systems. Named
  after the project that first successfully demonstrated coordinated long-range missile
  strikes, Hyperions can engage enemies from extreme distances, launching devastating
  barrages that saturate defensive systems.
  
  The Hyperion's design philosophy accepts lighter armor in exchange for maximum missile
  capacity and launch capability. Their enormous magazines can carry hundreds or even
  thousands of missiles, allowing them to sustain high-intensity fire missions that would
  exhaust conventional warships. Advanced targeting and coordination systems allow them
  to manage complex multi-missile attacks, timing impacts to overwhelm point defenses.
  
  Hyperion crews are specialists in missile warfare and fire coordination. Successful
  operations require perfect synchronization between fire control, magazine management,
  and tactical positioning. The best Hyperion commanders think several volleys ahead,
  managing ammunition reserves and coordinating with fleet elements to ensure their
  missiles achieve maximum effect. In large fleet actions, Hyperions often serve as
  force multipliers, their missile swarms turning the tide of battle.
