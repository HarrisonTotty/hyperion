# Lore and flavor
lore: >-
  Battleships represent the marriage of firepower and survivability. Unlike destroyers
  that rely on range, or cruisers that depend on versatility, battleships are built for
  one purpose: to close with the enemy and slug it out at close range. Their reinforced
  hulls and layered armor systems allow them to absorb punishing fire while their weapon
  batteries tear through enemy defenses.
  
  The battleship's tactical doctrine centers on the decisive engagement. These ships are
  fleet anchors, positioned to draw enemy fire and hold critical positions. Their presence
  alone can dictate the flow of battle, forcing enemies to commit resources or concede
  strategic positions. In the chaos of close-quarters combat, battleship crews must maintain
  discipline and coordination, as every second of sustained fire counts.
  
  Commanding a battleship requires nerves of steel. Unlike nimble vessels that can evade
  danger, battleship captains must trust their armor and commit fully to the fight. The best
  battleship commanders possess an almost preternatural ability to read damage reports and
  prioritize systems, keeping their ships in the fight long after lighter vessels would have
  withdrawn.
