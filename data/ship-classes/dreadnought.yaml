# Lore and flavor
lore: >-
  Dreadnoughts are the queens of the battlefield, massive vessels designed to project
  overwhelming force across vast distances. Their construction represents a staggering
  investment of resources and expertise, making each dreadnought a strategic asset of
  immense value. Nations rise and fall based on dreadnought counts—possessing even one
  of these vessels can shift the balance of power in an entire sector.
  
  The dreadnought's operational doctrine revolves around strategic dominance. Unlike
  smaller vessels designed for tactical flexibility, dreadnoughts are positioned to
  control entire regions of space through threat projection alone. Their sensor arrays
  can track dozens of targets simultaneously, while their weapon batteries can engage
  multiple enemies at ranges where return fire is ineffective.
  
  Commanding a dreadnought is the pinnacle of a naval career. These postings go only
  to the most experienced and politically connected officers, as the loss of even one
  dreadnought can end careers and topple governments. The responsibility weighs heavily—
  captains must balance aggressive use of their devastating firepower with the knowledge
  that their ship represents years of national treasure.
