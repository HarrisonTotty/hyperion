# Lore and flavor
lore: >-
  The frigate represents centuries of naval engineering tradition adapted for space combat.
  First deployed during the early expansion period, frigates have proven their worth in
  countless fleet actions. Their balanced design makes them versatile enough for escort duty,
  patrol operations, or fleet defense. Modern frigates incorporate lessons learned from
  decades of combat, featuring modular defensive systems and redundant critical components.
  
  Frigate crews are known for their professionalism and cohesion. The smaller complement
  compared to cruisers or battleships allows for tighter unit bonding and more responsive
  command structures. Many famous fleet admirals began their careers commanding frigates.
