# Lore and flavor
lore: >-
  Defenders represent the ultimate expression of defensive naval architecture—vessels
  designed to take punishment that would vaporize lesser ships and keep fighting. These
  massive vessels mount the thickest armor, most sophisticated damage control systems,
  and most extensive defensive arrays available. When a defender takes position, it
  becomes an immovable obstacle that enemies must either bypass or destroy at great cost.
  
  The defender's role in fleet doctrine is to create impenetrable defensive zones. Whether
  protecting static installations, convoy formations, or strategic positions, defenders
  establish areas of control that hostile forces cannot penetrate without committing
  overwhelming force. Their mere presence changes battlefield geometry, forcing enemies
  to route around them or accept catastrophic losses attempting breakthrough.
  
  Defender crews develop legendary reputations for stubbornness and resilience. These
  ships attract personnel who believe in holding the line regardless of odds. The famous
  defensive actions of history—desperate last stands that bought time for evacuations or
  reinforcements—often center on defender-class vessels refusing to yield. Their captains
  are chosen for unwavering determination and tactical defensive genius.
