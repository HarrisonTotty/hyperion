# Lore and flavor
lore: >-
  Scouts are the eyes and ears of any fleet, venturing into unknown or hostile territory
  to gather critical intelligence. These small vessels sacrifice firepower and armor for
  speed, stealth, and sensor capability. Their crews are often the first to encounter new
  phenomena, alien vessels, or enemy deployments—information they must survive long enough
  to report.
  
  The scout's greatest weapon is information. Their advanced sensor suites can detect
  enemy movements at extreme ranges, map gravitational anomalies, and analyze stellar
  phenomena. Coupled with stealth systems that minimize their own signature, scouts can
  observe enemy positions and movements without revealing their presence. This intelligence
  advantage can mean the difference between victory and defeat in fleet engagements.
  
  Scout crews are a special breed—patient, observant, and comfortable with isolation.
  Missions often involve weeks of silent running, maintaining radio silence while gathering
  data. The psychological demands are significant, requiring crews with strong bonds and
  mental resilience. Many famous explorers and intelligence officers began their careers
  on scout vessels.
