# Faction-specific manufacturers and variants
manufacturers:
  terran-federation:
    manufacturer: "Federal Fuels Division"
    variant: "Refueler-class"
    lore: >-
      Federation tankers are built to strict safety standards, with redundant containment
      systems and emergency venting capabilities. They're the lifeline of long-range fleet
      operations, allowing task forces to operate far from resupply bases.
  
  mars-coalition:
    manufacturer: "Tharsis Energy Transport"
    variant: "Fuel Runner-class"
    lore: >-
      Martian tankers prioritize rapid fuel transfer and combat zone operations. Their
      hardened fuel lines and armored tanks allow them to resupply ships under fire,
      though this comes with significant risk.
  
  belt-alliance:
    manufacturer: "Pallas Fuel Cooperative"
    variant: "Tankship-class"
    lore: >-
      Belt tankers are converted from old freighters and hollowed asteroids, providing
      massive fuel capacity at minimal cost. Their simple designs make them easy to
      maintain and repair in remote locations.
  
  europa-compact:
    manufacturer: "Europan Energy Services"
    variant: "Reservoir-class"
    lore: >-
      Europan tankers specialize in cryogenic fuel transport and exotic propellant storage.
      Their advanced cooling systems can handle the most volatile fuel types, making them
      invaluable for cutting-edge propulsion systems.
  
  outer-rim-collective:
    manufacturer: "Rimward Fuel Guild"
    variant: "Gas Station-class"
    lore: >-
      Outer Rim tankers are mobile fuel depots, often stationed at key navigation points
      to service passing ships. Many crews operate on profit-sharing agreements, making
      them highly motivated to maintain service quality.
  
  corporate-syndicate:
    manufacturer: "Petroleum Interstellar LLC"
    variant: "Energy Asset-class"
    lore: >-
      Corporate tankers are optimized for fuel transport economics, with automated
      transfer systems and standardized interfaces. Their predictable operations and
      insurance coverage make them reliable fleet support elements.

# Lore and flavor
lore: >-
  Tankers are the lifeblood of fleet operations, mobile fuel depots that enable ships
  to operate far beyond their normal range. Without tankers, navies would be tethered to
  fuel bases, unable to project power or conduct extended campaigns. These specialized
  vessels carry enormous quantities of volatile propellants, making them both invaluable
  assets and dangerous liabilities.
  
  The tanker's operational doctrine centers on enabling fleet mobility. By positioning
  themselves at strategic points, tankers create temporary supply networks that allow
  combat vessels to refuel without returning to base. Their fuel transfer systems can
  pump thousands of units per hour, getting ships back into action quickly. However, their
  volatile cargoes make them priority targets—losing a tanker can cripple an entire
  fleet's operational capacity.
  
  Tanker crews are specialists in fuel handling and safety procedures. Working with
  massive quantities of explosive propellants requires meticulous attention to detail
  and unwavering adherence to safety protocols. The best tanker captains can position
  their vessels to maximize fleet efficiency while minimizing exposure to enemy fire,
  a delicate balancing act that separates competent crews from legendary ones.
