# Faction-specific manufacturers and variants
manufacturers:
  terran-federation:
    manufacturer: "Terran Industrial Complex"
    variant: "Olympus-class"
    lore: >-
      Federation corvettes are designed as multi-role workhorses capable of extended
      independent operations. They feature redundant systems and extensive automation,
      allowing smaller crews to operate these large vessels effectively.
  
  mars-coalition:
    manufacturer: "Valles Marineris Shipbuilding"
    variant: "Sandstorm-class"
    lore: >-
      Martian corvettes prioritize modularity and battlefield adaptability. Built with
      quick-swap module bays, they can be reconfigured between missions to match evolving
      tactical requirements. Crew quarters are compact but efficient.
  
  belt-alliance:
    manufacturer: "Pallas Industrial Cooperative"
    variant: "Prospector-class"
    lore: >-
      Belt corvettes are rugged exploration and patrol vessels designed for long-duration
      missions without resupply. Their extensive cargo holds and efficient life support
      make them ideal for frontier operations.
  
  europa-compact:
    manufacturer: "Conamara Chaos Yards"
    variant: "Leviathan-class"
    lore: >-
      Europan corvettes incorporate unique water-based cooling systems and bio-integrated
      components. Their unusual aesthetics hide sophisticated sensor arrays optimized for
      deep space scanning and ice navigation.
  
  outer-rim-collective:
    manufacturer: "Rimward Assembly Works"
    variant: "Pathfinder-class"
    lore: >-
      Outer Rim corvettes are assembled from proven components sourced across dozens of
      suppliers. While lacking cutting-edge tech, their reliability and ease of maintenance
      make them favorites among independent operators.
  
  corporate-syndicate:
    manufacturer: "Weyland-Omnicorp Solutions"
    variant: "Profit-Maximizer MkVII"
    lore: >-
      Corporate corvettes emphasize cost-per-engagement metrics and standardized components.
      Built in massive automated facilities, they sacrifice individuality for economies of
      scale and guaranteed parts availability.

# Lore and flavor
lore: >-
  Corvettes represent the pinnacle of multi-role design philosophy. Too large to be nimble
  like frigates, yet too small to match battleship firepower, corvettes instead excel at
  adaptability. Their extensive module capacity allows field commanders to reconfigure
  these ships for whatever mission profile is required—anti-fighter screening, long-range
  patrol, convoy escort, or even light assault operations.
  
  The corvette's versatility comes at a cost: they require skilled, experienced crews to
  operate at peak efficiency. Without clear specialization, corvette commanders must be
  tactical generalists, able to assess situations and adapt on the fly. This has led to
  corvettes serving as training grounds for future capital ship commanders.
  
  In fleet compositions, corvettes serve as force multipliers, filling gaps and adapting
  to changing battlefield conditions. Their cost-effectiveness makes them popular with
  resource-constrained factions, while wealthy navies appreciate their operational flexibility.
