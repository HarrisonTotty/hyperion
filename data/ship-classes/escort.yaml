# Lore and flavor
lore: >-
  Escorts are the dedicated guardians of fleet formations and convoys, small vessels
  optimized for defensive operations. Unlike interceptors that hunt aggressively or
  frigates that provide area defense, escorts maintain close proximity to protected
  assets, ready to intercept any threat that penetrates outer defensive layers.
  
  The escort's tactical doctrine centers on threat prioritization and engagement timing.
  With limited firepower compared to dedicated warships, escort commanders must choose
  their targets wisely—a missile that gets through could cripple a valuable freighter,
  while wasting ammunition on decoys leaves the formation vulnerable. The best escort
  captains develop almost precognitive threat assessment abilities.
  
  Escort duty is often underappreciated but critically important. While not as glamorous
  as fleet actions or exploration, escorts enable commerce and logistics—the lifeblood
  of civilization. Merchant captains know the value of good escort crews, and many form
  long-standing relationships with particular escort vessels, requesting them by name
  for dangerous routes.
