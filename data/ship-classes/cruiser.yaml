# Lore and flavor
lore: >-
  Cruisers are the workhorse vessels of most navies, balancing affordability with capability.
  Their small size and crew complement make them economical to operate, while their versatile
  module capacity allows them to handle patrol, escort, reconnaissance, and light combat duties.
  
  The cruiser's compact profile makes it ideal for rapid deployment and quick response scenarios.
  Fleet admirals appreciate their ability to be everywhere at once—what they lack in individual
  firepower, they make up for in numbers and ubiquity. A well-coordinated cruiser squadron can
  control vast regions of space, deterring piracy and responding to emergencies.
  
  Cruiser duty is often the first posting for newly commissioned officers, providing invaluable
  experience in independent command. The intimate crew size fosters strong bonds and esprit de
  corps. Many veterans fondly recall their cruiser days as the most formative of their careers.
