# Lore and flavor
lore: >-
  Destroyers are the offensive backbone of modern space navies. Purpose-built for
  stand-off engagement, these ships mount powerful weapon arrays optimized for range
  and precision. Their role in fleet doctrine is clear: establish fire superiority,
  eliminate high-value targets, and suppress enemy formations before they can threaten
  friendly capital ships.
  
  The destroyer's design philosophy prioritizes firepower over defense. Their hulls are
  lighter than frigates of comparable size, sacrificing armor for additional weapon
  mounts and fire control systems. This glass cannon approach requires skilled crews
  who can maximize their standoff advantage while avoiding close-quarters brawls where
  their vulnerabilities become critical.
  
  Destroyer commanders are known for their aggressive, calculating nature. Success
  requires perfect timing—knowing when to unleash devastating salvos and when to break
  off and reposition. The most celebrated destroyer captains can read fleet movements
  like chess masters, positioning their ships for maximum impact.
