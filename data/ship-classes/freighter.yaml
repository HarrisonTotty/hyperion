# Lore and flavor
lore: >-
  Freighters are the unsung heroes of civilization, massive vessels that move the goods
  and materials that keep worlds running. Without their constant traffic between systems,
  colonies would starve, industries would halt, and economies would collapse. These
  utilitarian vessels may lack the glamour of warships or the prestige of passenger liners,
  but they are the true backbone of interstellar society.
  
  The freighter's design is all about capacity and efficiency. Every cubic meter of their
  massive hulls is optimized for cargo, with modular hold configurations allowing them to
  carry everything from grain to manufactured goods to raw ore. Their slow speed and poor
  maneuverability are accepted tradeoffs for the ability to move thousands of tons in a
  single voyage.
  
  Freighter crews develop a distinct culture—pragmatic, self-reliant, and deeply
  knowledgeable about cargo handling and ship maintenance. Many are family operations,
  with multiple generations living aboard the same vessel. The best freighter captains
  can maximize profits through careful route planning and cargo selection, becoming
  wealthy through patient accumulation rather than spectacular risks.
