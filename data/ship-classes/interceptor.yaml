# Faction-specific manufacturers and variants
manufacturers:
  terran-federation:
    manufacturer: "Northrop Aerospace Division"
    variant: "Raptor-class"
    lore: >-
      Federation interceptors are precision instruments built around powerful engines
      and agile thruster arrays. They serve as the first line of defense, scrambling
      to meet incoming threats before they can reach critical assets.
  
  mars-coalition:
    manufacturer: "Acidalia Strike Craft Works"
    variant: "Lightning-class"
    lore: >-
      Martian interceptors embrace extreme performance over survivability. Their
      overpowered engines and aggressive flight profiles make them the fastest combat
      vessels in service, though pilot attrition rates are concerningly high.
  
  belt-alliance:
    manufacturer: "Hebe Light Craft Collective"
    variant: "Dart-class"
    lore: >-
      Belt interceptors are lightweight and economical, built for swarm tactics.
      What they lack in individual capability they make up for in numbers and
      coordinated pack hunting strategies.
  
  europa-compact:
    manufacturer: "Cilix Flight Systems"
    variant: "Striker-class"
    lore: >-
      Europan interceptors feature unique vectored thrust systems inspired by
      marine biology. Their unconventional flight characteristics make them
      unpredictable opponents in dogfights.
  
  outer-rim-collective:
    manufacturer: "Rimward Rapid Response"
    variant: "Chaser-class"
    lore: >-
      Outer Rim interceptors are built from racing craft and courier vessels
      retrofitted with weapons. Their civilian heritage shows in their reliability
      and ease of maintenance, if not their combat optimization.
  
  corporate-syndicate:
    manufacturer: "Security Dynamics Inc."
    variant: "Asset Protector-class"
    lore: >-
      Corporate interceptors are standardized platforms designed for minimum training
      time and maximum availability. They prioritize pilot safety over pure performance,
      reflecting corporate liability concerns.

# Lore and flavor
lore: >-
  Interceptors represent the fighter jet philosophy applied to space combat—speed,
  agility, and hitting power in the smallest possible package. These ships are built
  for one mission: to catch and destroy enemy vessels before they can reach their
  targets. Every design decision prioritizes acceleration and maneuverability, with
  armor and endurance being acceptable sacrifices.
  
  The interceptor pilot's creed is "first contact, first kill." Their role is to
  scramble at a moment's notice, racing to intercept incoming threats. Whether it's
  enemy strike craft, missiles, or fast-moving raiders, interceptors must arrive
  first and eliminate the threat decisively. This requires not just speed but also
  exceptional piloting skill and split-second decision making.
  
  Interceptor squadrons develop fierce competitive spirits and aggressive cultures.
  Pilots track their intercept times and kill counts, with elite squadrons earning
  feared reputations. The small crew size—often just pilot and weapons officer—creates
  intensely close partnerships. The best interceptor pairs can communicate without
  words, their coordination approaching telepathy.
