      into wasting anti-missile countermeasures.
  'Decoy Torpedo':
    desc: >-
      A torpedo with an empty warhead and false scan signal to trick enemy ships
      into wasting anti-missile countermeasures.
  'MK 1 Antimatter Torpedo':
    desc: >-

      a much larger distance at a faster speed.
  'MK 5 Nuclear Missile':
    desc: >-
      Armed with a thermonuclear warhead, this slower-moving missile deals a
      large amount of damage over a large blast radius.
  'MK 8 Nuclear Torpedo':
    desc: >-
      Armed with a thermonuclear warhead, this slow-moving torpedo deals a large
      amount of damage over a very large blast radius.
  'MK 9 Antimatter Missile':
    desc: >-
      Armed with a warhead filled with antinuclear material, this slower-moving
      missile is capable of dealing a large amount of damage to a compact blast
      radius.
  'Type 1 Ion Missile':
    desc: >-
      A variant of the standard guided missile that trades damage for the
      capability of temporarily jamming enemy communications, sensors, and
      lock-on capabilities.
  'Type 1 Ion Torpedo':
    desc: >-
      Delivering a moderate amount of damage in a decent blast radius, ion
      torpedoes also have the capability of temporarily jamming enemy
      communications, sensors, and lock-on capabilities.
  'Type 2 Plasma Missile':
    desc: >-
      A variant of the standard guided missile that excels at dealing additional
      damage to enemy shields but is not effective against unshielded targets.
  'Type 2 Plasma Torpedo':
    desc: >-
      Plasma torpedoes excel at dealing additional damage to enemy shields but
      are not effective against unshielded targets.
  'Type 3 Positron Missile':
    desc: >-
      A missile armed with a positron warhead, dealing less damage than the MK
      11 but allowing some of the damage to bypass shields.
  'Type 3 Positron Torpedo':
    desc: >-
      A torpedo armed with a positron warhead, allowing some of the damage to
      bypass shields.
  'Type 4 Tachyon Missile':
    desc: >-
      A missile armed with a tachyon warhead, dealing less damage than the MK 11
      but temporarily preventing the target from utilizing its FTL drive.
  'Type 4 Tachyon Torpedo':
    desc: >-
      A torpedo armed with a tachyon warhead, dealing less damage than the MK 3
      but temporarily preventing the target from utilizing its FTL drive.
  'Type 5 Graviton Missile':
    desc: >-
      A missile armed with a graviton warhead, dealing less damage than the MK
      11 but temporarily increasing the mass of the target, causing it to move
      slower and reducing its maneuverability.
  'Type 5 Graviton Torpedo':
    desc: >-
      A torpedo armed with a graviton warhead, dealing less damage than the MK 3
      but temporarily increasing the mass of the target, causing it to move
