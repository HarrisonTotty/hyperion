# Maneuvering Thrusters
# ---------------------

maneuvering_thrusters:
  'Ion Thrusters':
    desc: >-
      Uses a series of small ion engines to produce a small amount of angular
      thrust with good energy efficiency.
  'Magneto Thrusters':
    desc: >-
      Actually not a series of thrusters at all, this series of electromagnets
      is capable of naturally aligning to regional flux, generating a large
      amount of angular thrust at low energy consumption.
  'Material Thrusters':
    desc: >-
      By ejecting solid material out of the thruster head, this type of
      maneuvering thruster has been used since the 1960's. Produces a decent
      amount of angular thrust at a high energy consumption.
  'Plasma Thrusters':
    desc: >-
      By expelling large amounts of plasma through magnetic fields, this set of
      maneuvering thrusters are capable of generating large amounts of thrust at
      the cost of energy efficiency.
  'Smart Thrusters':
    desc: >-
      A more efficient variant of the standard material thruster that uses
      artificial mass compensation to improve turn speeds.
