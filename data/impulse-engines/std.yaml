  'Higgs Field "Surfing" Engines':
    desc: >-
      Just as the warp core is able to bend space to allow FTL travel, these
      engines combine ion impulse with bending the localized Higgs field,
      producing a good amount of thrust while still remaining energy efficient.
  'Ion Engines':
    desc: >-
      Ion impulse engines provide little forward thrust but are extremely energy
      efficient.
  'Neutrino Tethering Engines':
    desc: >-
      By (somehow) paramagnetically tethering to natural neutrinos as they pass
      through a containment field, these engines are capable of producing large
      amounts of thrust at good energy efficiency.
  'Plasma Induction Engines':
    desc: >-
      By expelling large amounts of plasma through magnetic fields, this set of
      impulse engines are capable of generating large amounts of thrust at the
      cost of energy efficiency.
  'Scram Pulse Engines':
    desc: >-
      By expelling massive quantities of charged nuclear material out the back
      of this engine, it is capable of generating massive amounts of thrust at a
      very low energy efficiency,
  'Solar Sail':
    desc: >-
      By far the most efficient form of slow, long-distance travel, solar sails
      use captured sunlight to produce a very small amount of thrust.
