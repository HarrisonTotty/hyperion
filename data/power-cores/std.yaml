power_cores:
  'Antinuclear Reactor':
    desc: >-
      A reactor that forces the fusion of antinuclear material to generate
      massive amounts of energy compared to regular fusion reactors.
  'Condensed Plasma Battery':
    desc: >-
      Utilizing hypercompressed plasma, this power core is capable of storing
      large amounts of energy but cannot produce any energy of its own.
  'High-Energy Boson Reactor':
    desc: >-
      An updated version of the antinuclear reactor that is capable of greatly
      increasing energy storage via paramagnetic boson induction.
  'Mark III Fission Reactor':
    desc: >-
      A basic nuclear fission reactor core capable of slowly restoring its
      energy reserves if power is cut from other ship systems.
  'Mark IV Fusion Reactor':
    desc: >-
      A reactor that utilizes nuclear fusion technology to generate a larger
      amount of energy per second compared to the standard fission reactor.
  'Neutrino Pulsion Core':
    desc: >-
      A reactor capable of generating unparalleled amounts of energy via
      neutrino capture. However, the sheer size of the production system leaves
      little room for energy storage.
