lore: >-
  Apex Precision's Sniper system redefines long-range combat. Advanced targeting algorithms
  and micro-stabilization gyros enable pinpoint accuracy at distances where other weapons
  are wildly inaccurate. Designated marksmen aboard capital ships use the Sniper to
  surgically disable enemy subsystems from 12,000 kilometers away. The slower fire rate
  is irrelevant when every shot is a guaranteed hit on your chosen target.
