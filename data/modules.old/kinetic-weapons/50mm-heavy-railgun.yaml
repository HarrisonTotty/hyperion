description: "Capital ship railgun delivering devastating armor penetration at extreme range."
cost: 600
model: "EM-50 Lancer"
manufacturer: "Prometheus Heavy Industries"
lore: >-
  Prometheus Heavy Industries' Lancer is the weapon that redefined capital ship warfare.
  Advanced capacitor banks and superconducting rails accelerate 50mm projectiles to
  velocities exceeding Mach 6, delivering kinetic energy that can punch clean through
  dreadnought armor plating. Each shot draws enough power to dim the lights across three
  decks, but when you absolutely need to kill something at 10,000 kilometers, accept no
  substitutes.
