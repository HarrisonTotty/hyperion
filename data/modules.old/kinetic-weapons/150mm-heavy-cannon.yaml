cost: 280
model: "Mark IX Thunderstrike"
manufacturer: "Titan Ordnance Systems"
lore: >-
  Titan Ordnance's Thunderstrike is where cannons transition from 'weapons' to 'ship killers.'
  Each 150mm shell carries enough explosive force to gut a destroyer's midsection. The slower
  reload time demands tactical precision - you don't spray and pray with a Thunderstrike,
  you wait for the perfect shot and make it count. Cruiser and battleship captains swear
  by its devastating salvos.
