description: "Legendary siege weapon firing vehicle-sized shells capable of breaching any known armor."
cost: 800
model: "Omega-Class Worldbreaker"
manufacturer: "Prometheus Heavy Industries"
lore: >-
  The Worldbreaker is less a weapon and more a statement of intent. Reserved exclusively
  for dreadnoughts and siege platforms, it fires 300mm shells the size of small vehicles
  with enough kinetic energy to reduce fortifications to atoms. Each shot requires five
  seconds to reload, draws power from dedicated capacitor banks, and produces a muzzle
  flash visible from orbit. When you absolutely, positively need to break a world - accept
  no substitutes.
