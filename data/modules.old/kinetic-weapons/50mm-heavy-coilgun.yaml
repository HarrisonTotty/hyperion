name: "50mm Heavy Coilgun"
description: "Heavy coilgun with hundreds of precision magnetic coils delivering extreme accuracy and velocity."
cost: 580
model: "MG-50 Hammer"
manufacturer: "Titan Ordnance Systems"
lore: >-
  The MG-50 'Hammer' represents the apex of coilgun engineering. Its extended acceleration
  barrel houses hundreds of precision-tuned magnetic coils that progressively accelerate
  projectiles to devastating velocities. Where railguns sacrifice accuracy for raw power,
  the Hammer delivers both - though at significantly higher cost and maintenance complexity.
  Preferred by captains who demand perfection in their weapons systems.
