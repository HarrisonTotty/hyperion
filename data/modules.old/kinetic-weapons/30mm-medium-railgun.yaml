description: "Medium-class railgun launching tungsten-carbide slugs at extreme velocities."
cost: 350
model: "EM-30 Thunderbolt"
manufacturer: "Electromagnetic Dynamics Corp."
lore: >-
  EMD's Thunderbolt represents the sweet spot in railgun design - powerful enough to threaten
  capital ships, yet efficient enough for cruiser and destroyer mounting. Tungsten-carbide
  slugs achieve velocities that conventional weapons simply cannot match, delivering superior
  range and penetration. The power draw is significant, but most captains consider it a
  worthwhile trade for the Thunderbolt's battlefield performance.
