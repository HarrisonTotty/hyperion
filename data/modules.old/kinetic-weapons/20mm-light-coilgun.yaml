description: "Lightweight magnetic coilgun with superior reliability and minimal maintenance requirements."
cost: 180
model: "MG-20 Wasp"
manufacturer: "Magnetic Accelerator Systems"
lore: >-
  The MG-20 'Wasp' exemplifies the advantages of coilgun technology. Sequential electromagnetic
  coils accelerate projectiles without physical contact, eliminating the rail erosion that
  plagues electromagnetic railguns. The result is exceptional reliability and consistent
  velocity across thousands of rounds. Field mechanics love it for its minimal maintenance needs.
