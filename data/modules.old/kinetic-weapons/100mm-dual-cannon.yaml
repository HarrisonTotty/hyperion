description: "Twin-barreled cannon system doubling the firepower of standard medium weapons."
cost: 280
model: "Twin-Linked Havoc Battery"
manufacturer: "Aegis Armaments Corp."
lore: >-
  Aegis Armaments' answer to the 'more dakka' problem was elegantly simple: mount two
  Devastators side-by-side and fire them simultaneously. The Havoc Battery delivers
  punishing volleys that can shred through enemy shields and hull plating. Ammunition
  consumption is ferocious and accuracy suffers slightly from the twin-barrel recoil,
  but few targets survive a sustained Havoc barrage.
