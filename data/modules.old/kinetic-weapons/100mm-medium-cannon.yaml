  The Mark VII 'Devastator' is the standard by which all medium ship weapons are measured.
  Suitable for destroyers and light cruisers, it achieves an ideal balance between firepower,

  single weapon model, a testament to Aegis Armaments' reputation for building practical,
  effective weapons that get the job done.
