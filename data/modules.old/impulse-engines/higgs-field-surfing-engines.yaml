name: Higgs Field "Surfing" Engines
model: HFS-7 Higgs Field Surfing Engine
kind: Higgs Field Engine
manufacturer: Quantum Propulsion Labs
desc: >-
  Just as the warp core is able to bend space to allow FTL travel, these
  engines combine ion impulse with bending the localized higgs field,
  producing a good amount of thrust while still remaining energy efficient.
cost: 280
weight: 180
thrust: 900
