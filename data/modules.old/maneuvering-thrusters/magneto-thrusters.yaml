type: "maneuvering-thruster"
name: "Magneto Thrusters"
description: "Electromagnetic flux aligners that generate angular thrust by interacting with local magnetic fields."
cost: 350
model: "MT-5000"
manufacturer: "Quantum Dynamics Corporation"
lore: >-
  Not thrusters in the traditional sense, the MT-5000 array uses powerful electromagnets
  to align with and push against ambient magnetic fields. Exceptionally efficient in
  regions with strong flux patterns, though performance degrades in deep space. Popular
  among survey vessels operating near stellar bodies.
