description: "Devastating multi-beam laser array that converges into a single ultra-high-energy strike."
cost: 350
model: "SCL-9000"
manufacturer: "Advanced Photonics Corporation"
lore: >-
  APC's SCL-9000 is a masterwork of destructive engineering. Multiple synchrotron rings
  generate coherent laser beams that converge at a focal point up to 12,000 kilometers
  away. The convergence time creates a distinctive firing delay, but the resulting energy
  spike can punch through capital ship armor. Power-hungry and expensive, but worth every
  credit when you absolutely need something dead.
