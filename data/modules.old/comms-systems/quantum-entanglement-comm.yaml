name: Quantum Entanglement Communicator
model: QEC-1000 Quantum Link
kind: Quantum Communicator
manufacturer: Tesseract Systems
desc: >-
  Cutting-edge quantum entanglement-based communication system providing
  instantaneous, untraceable communication across any distance. Maximum
  encryption strength with minimal energy consumption.
lore: >-
  Quantum entanglement communications represent the pinnacle of FTL messaging.
  By exploiting quantum pairs, the QEC-1000 achieves truly instantaneous 
  communication across any distance. Prohibitively expensive, they are typically
  reserved for flagship vessels and critical diplomatic missions. The encryption
  is theoretically unbreakable due to quantum mechanics principles.
