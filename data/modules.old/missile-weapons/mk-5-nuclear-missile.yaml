lore: >-
  The MK 5 embodies the terrifying elegance of fusion weaponry. When its thermonuclear
  warhead detonates, temperatures briefly exceed those at the core of a star. The
  resulting plasma wave expands at hypersonic speeds, vaporizing everything within
  250 meters. Multiple interstellar treaties restrict its use to specific scenarios,
  but desperate fleet commanders have never let regulations stand between them and victory.
