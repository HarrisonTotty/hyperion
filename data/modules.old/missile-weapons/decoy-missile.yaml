lore: >-
  Tactical Deception Systems' decoy missile is psychological warfare made manifest.
  It broadcasts false targeting signatures identical to genuine strike missiles,
  forcing enemy point defense to choose between threats. Most choose wrong. Even
  when identified, the mere presence of decoys complicates defensive fire solutions
  and burns through countermeasure supplies. A cheap, effective force multiplier that
  turns every salvo into a shell game.
