lore: >-
  AOS's Type 1 represents electronic warfare in missile form. Instead of explosive
  force, it delivers a concentrated electromagnetic pulse designed to scramble enemy
  electronics. Sensors go blind, communications fail, targeting locks dissolve into
  static. The reduced kinetic damage is irrelevant when you can leave enemy vessels
  deaf, dumb, and vulnerable for your follow-up strike.
