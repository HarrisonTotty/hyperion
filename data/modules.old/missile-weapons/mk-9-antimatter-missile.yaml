description: "Devastating antimatter warhead delivering catastrophic damage in a focused blast radius."
cost: 30
model: "MK 9"
manufacturer: "Extreme Ordnance Corporation"
lore: >-
  Extreme Ordnance Corporation's MK 9 brings matter-antimatter annihilation to the
  tactical missile platform. When antimatter meets matter, total conversion to energy
  occurs - Einstein's E=mc² in its purest, most destructive form. The slower flight
  speed is a acceptable trade-off for the devastating yield. Captains report that
  hitting a target with an MK 9 is like watching a miniature star go supernova.
