cost: 12
model: "MK 3 HE"
manufacturer: "SteelArrow Inc."
lore: >-
  The MK 3 represents old-school torpedo design philosophy: pack as much explosive
  as possible into a dumb-fire projectile and point it at something you want gone.
  No fancy guidance systems, no exotic warheads - just several hundred kilograms of
  high explosive traveling at 700 meters per second. Simple, brutal, and horrifyingly
  effective against static targets and capital ships too large to evade.
