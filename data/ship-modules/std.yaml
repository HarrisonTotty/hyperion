ship_modules:
  'Anti-Missile System':
    desc: >-
      Adds a tube for the deployment of chaff, flares, and flak countermeasures
      against enemy missiles, rockets, and torpedoes.
  'Auxiliary Support System':
    desc: >-
      Adds a reserve support system capable of supplying emergency energy or
      recharging shields.
  'Cargo Bay':
    desc: >-
      Adds a cargo bay to the ship.
  'Communication System':
    desc: >-
      Allows the ship to communicate to other vessels and stations.
    required: true
  'Cooling System':
    desc: >-
      Adds a cooling system to the power core that may be activated to cool
      modules before or after they overheat.
  'Deflective Plating':
    desc: >-
      Adds a layer of protective plating on the ship to absorb or prevent damage
      to other modules. Particularly effective against directed-energy weapons.
      Each layer reduces damage from directed-energy weapons by 5% and other
      weapons by 2%.
  'Directed-Energy Weapon Port':
    desc: >-
      Adds a weapon port to the ship design which may be outfitted with
      directed-energy weapons such as lasers, phasers, plasma weapons, or
      particle beam weapons.
  'FTL Drive':
    desc: >-
      Allows the ship to travel faster than the speed of light.
    required: true
  'Hanger Bay':
    desc: >-
      Adds a hanger bay to the ship, allowing it to carry fighters, bombers, or
      escape shuttles.
  'Impulse Engines':
    desc: >-
      Generates forward thrust for the ship.
    required: true
  'Kinetic Weapon Port':
    desc: >-
      Adds a weapon port to the ship design which may be outfitted with kinetic
      weapons such as cannons or rail guns.
  'Maneuvering Thrusters':
    desc: >-
      Allows the ship to change course.
    required: true
  'Missile Tube':
    desc: >-
      Adds a missile tube to the ship design that supports the loading of
      various missiles, rockets, and torpedoes.
  'Power Module':
    desc: >-
      Generates and/or stores energy for other ship modules.
    required: true
  'Radial Emission System':
    desc: >-
      Adds an energy emission system on all sides of the ship, allowing it to
      detonate radial pulse weapons such as sensor jammers and EMP pulses.
  'Sensor Array':
    desc: >-
      Allows the ship to scan and accurately navigate through space.
    required: true
  'Shield Generator':
    desc: >-
      Adds a rechargeable shield to the ship to absorb or deflect damage.
      Particularly effective against kinetic weapons. Adding multiple shield
      generators increases the base effectiveness of the shield. Each shield
      generator reduces damage to shields from kinetic weapons by 2% and adds
      a maximum of 500 shield hit points.
  'Stealth System':
    desc: >-
      Adds a series of scanner signature masking systems to the ship that may be
      activated, allowing it to remain undetected on enemy long-range scanners.
