lore: >-
  The IJD-5000 allows capital ships to jump across entire star systems in
  an instant. The massive power requirements and lengthy cooldown periods
  mean these drives are primarily used for strategic repositioning rather
  than tactical combat. Jump calculations at these distances require
  sophisticated navigation computers and precise timing.
