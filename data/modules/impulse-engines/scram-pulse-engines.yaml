desc: >-
  By expelling massive quantities of charged nuclear material out the back
  of this engine, it is capable of generating massive amounts of thrust at
  a very low energy efficiency.
lore: >-
  EPI's SPE-1000 is favored by military vessels requiring maximum acceleration.
  The trade-off in fuel efficiency is considered acceptable for combat
  operations where speed can mean the difference between life and death.
