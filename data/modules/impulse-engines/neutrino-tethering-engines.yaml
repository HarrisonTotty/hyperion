name: Neutrino Tethering Engines
model: NTE-X Neutrino Tethering Engine
manufacturer: Advanced Propulsion Dynamics
desc: >-
  By (somehow) paramagnetically tethering to natural neutrinos as they pass
  through a containment field, these engines are capable of producing large
  amounts of thrust at good energy efficiency.
lore: >-
  APD's NTE-X remains largely theoretical in its operation, but field results
  are undeniable. Neutrino tethering provides excellent thrust with minimal
  power draw, though the containment field requirements remain complex.
