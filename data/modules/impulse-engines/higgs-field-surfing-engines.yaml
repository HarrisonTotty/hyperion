name: Higgs Field "Surfing" Engines
model: HFS-7 Higgs Field Surfing Engine
manufacturer: Quantum Propulsion Labs
desc: >-
  Just as the warp core is able to bend space to allow FTL travel, these
  engines combine ion impulse with bending the localized higgs field,
  producing a good amount of thrust while still remaining energy efficient.
lore: >-
  QPL's breakthrough HFS-7 represents the cutting edge of sublight propulsion
  technology, using quantum field manipulation to achieve previously impossible
  thrust-to-efficiency ratios.
