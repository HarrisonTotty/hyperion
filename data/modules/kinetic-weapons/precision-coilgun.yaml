  The Sharpshooter is Precision Munitions' answer to long-range surgical strikes.
  Multiple electromagnetic coils accelerate 30mm slugs to hypersonic velocities with
  unprecedented accuracy. The complex targeting integration and cooling requirements
  result in slow firing cycles, but skilled marksmen can disable critical subsystems
  from extreme distances where other weapons lose effectiveness.
