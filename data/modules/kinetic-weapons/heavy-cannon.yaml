desc: >-
  Powerful heavy cannon firing 200mm shells for maximum damage against armored targets.
lore: >-
  Titan's Thor cannon is built for one purpose: punching through heavy armor plating.
  The massive 200mm shells deliver devastating kinetic impact that can crack open
  battleship hulls. The weapon's prodigious recoil and slower rate of fire demand
  skilled gunnery, but a well-placed Thor shot can decide fleet engagements.
