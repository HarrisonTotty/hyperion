desc: >-
  Multi-barrel rotary railgun delivering sustained rapid fire with moderate accuracy.
lore: >-
  Velocity Arms revolutionized close-range combat with the Storm's rotating barrel assembly.
  Six electromagnetic rails fire in sequence, maintaining continuous fire pressure that
  overwhelms point defenses and keeps enemy shields under constant stress. The rotating
  design distributes heat buildup, enabling sustained fire that would melt conventional
  railguns. Accuracy at range suffers, but in knife-fight engagements, nothing matches
  the Storm's suppressive firepower.
