  Rapid-fire autocannon system delivering high volume of fire at the cost of accuracy.
lore: >-
  Tempest's Havoc autocannon embodies the 'more dakka' philosophy. Twin rotating barrels
  spit out 100mm shells in rapid succession, creating a storm of steel that can shred
  through shields and light armor. Accuracy suffers from the violent recoil, but the
  sheer volume of projectiles ensures hits on target. Ammunition consumption is ferocious.
