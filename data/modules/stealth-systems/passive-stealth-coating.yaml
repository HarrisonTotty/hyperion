desc: "Radar-absorbent coating that reduces sensor signature. Always active with no power cost."
lore: >-
  STC's passive stealth coating uses advanced metamaterials to absorb
  radar and sensor emissions, making ships significantly harder to detect.
  The coating requires no power and works continuously, though it's less
  effective than active stealth systems.
