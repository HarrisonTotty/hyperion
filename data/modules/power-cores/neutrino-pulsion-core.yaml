model: "NPC-4000"
manufacturer: "Advanced Fusion Technologies"
desc: >-
  Captures ambient neutrinos and converts them to usable energy. Low output
  but requires no fuel and runs indefinitely.
lore: >-
  Advanced Fusion Technologies' revolutionary NPC-4000 harvests the constant
  stream of neutrinos passing through all matter. While the power output is
  modest compared to fusion reactors, the system requires zero fuel and will
  operate for centuries without maintenance. Popular with deep space explorers
  and generation ships where fuel resupply is impossible.
