name: "Condensed Plasma Battery"
model: "CPB-2000"
manufacturer: "Energex Corporation"
desc: >-
  A high-capacity energy storage system using compressed plasma in magnetic bottles.
  Exceptional energy density but lower generation rate.
lore: >-
  Energex's CPB-2000 takes a different approach to power generation, prioritizing
  energy storage over production. The condensed plasma provides a massive energy
  reserve, perfect for ships that need sustained power for extended operations or
  to power high-draw systems in short bursts.
