model: "ANR-3500"
manufacturer: "Stellar Dynamics Ltd"
desc: >-
  Matter-antimatter annihilation reactor. Incredible power generation but
  requires careful handling and antimatter fuel.
lore: >-
  Stellar Dynamics' ANR-3500 harnesses the ultimate energy source: matter-antimatter
  annihilation. Each reaction releases pure energy at 100% efficiency, but the
  containment systems must be flawless. A single magnetic bottle failure could
  vaporize the entire ship. Only the most experienced engineering crews dare to
  operate these systems.
