desc: >-
  Exotic matter reactor using Higgs boson decay. Extremely high power output
  but requires specialized maintenance and fuel.
lore: >-
  Quantum Energy Systems' HEBR-5000 pushes the boundaries of known physics,
  harvesting energy from controlled Higgs boson decay. The technology is
  barely understood outside of theoretical physics circles, but its power
  output is undeniable. Maintenance crews require advanced certifications,
  and fuel costs are astronomical.
