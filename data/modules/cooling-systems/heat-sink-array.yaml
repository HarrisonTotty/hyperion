name: "Thermal Heat Sink Array"
model: "HSA-400 Heat Sink Array"
manufacturer: "Thermal Dynamics Inc."
desc: "Passive heat sinks that absorb thermal energy. Lower ongoing cost but limited capacity."
lore: >-
  The HSA-400 uses advanced thermal mass materials to absorb and slowly radiate
  heat. While requiring minimal power, the heat sinks must be periodically
  serviced to maintain efficiency as thermal degradation occurs over time.
