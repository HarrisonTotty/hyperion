desc: >-
  Devastating particle cannon delivering massive energy discharge with long recharge cycles.
lore: >-
  Titan's Nova cannon represents the pinnacle of directed energy weaponry. Each discharge
  releases a focused stream of accelerated particles that can punch through battleship
  armor plating. The weapon's prodigious energy requirements and cooling needs result
  in slower recharge times, but a direct hit from the Nova can cripple even the most
  heavily armored vessels. Capital ship captains learn to fear the telltale energy
  buildup that precedes a Nova strike.
