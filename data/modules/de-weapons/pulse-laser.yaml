desc: >-
  Rapid-fire pulse laser sacrificing damage per shot for exceptional firing rate.
lore: >-
  Velocity Arms designed the Staccato for close-range brawls where sustained fire
  pressure matters more than raw damage. The pulse system fires discrete laser bursts
  in rapid succession, each dealing modest damage but recharging almost instantly.
  The cumulative effect can shred through shields and keep enemy systems under constant
  stress. Effective range is limited by the pulsed beam's dispersion, but within
  optimal distance, few weapons match its sustained DPS.
