desc: >-
  Ultra-long-range precision laser with extended maximum range and focused beam coherence.
lore: >-
  Precision Munitions engineered the Longshot for surgical strikes from extreme distances.
  Advanced focusing arrays and beam coherence systems extend effective range far beyond
  standard energy weapons, allowing ships to engage targets before entering their
  engagement envelope. Damage output is moderate and recharge cycles are lengthy, but
  the tactical advantage of extreme-range fire superiority cannot be overstated. Fleet
  commanders use Longshot-equipped vessels as fire support platforms that can influence
  battles from safe distances.
