  SunScore's FocalPoint L-7 is the standard light energy weapon across known space.
  Its compact design and minimal power draw make it ideal for escort vessels and
  patrol craft. While individual shots lack the punch of heavier weapons, the rapid
  recharge cycle enables sustained fire that can wear down shields and ablate armor.
  The instant beam travel time ensures hits at any range within the weapon's envelope.
