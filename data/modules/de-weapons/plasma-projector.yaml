desc: >-
  Plasma weapon launching superheated bolts with travel time but devastating shield damage.
lore: >-
  Tempest's Inferno breaks the mold of traditional directed energy weapons by projecting
  coherent plasma bolts rather than instant beams. The magnetically-contained plasma
  travels at relativistic speeds but not light speed, requiring gunners to lead targets.
  This trade-off brings exceptional damage against shields as the plasma disrupts
  electromagnetic containment fields. The weapon excels in the anti-shield role but
  requires more skill to use effectively.
