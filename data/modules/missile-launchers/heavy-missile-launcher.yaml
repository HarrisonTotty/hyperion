  Large-capacity launcher designed for sustained engagements with extended magazine capacity.
lore: >-
  Titan Armaments built the MK-VII for capital ships that need to maintain missile
  pressure over extended battles. The massive magazine holds twice the ordnance of
  standard launchers, though reload cycles are slower and the launcher can only
  fire one missile at a time to conserve ammunition flow.
