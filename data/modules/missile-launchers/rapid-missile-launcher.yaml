desc: >-
  High-speed launcher optimized for rapid sequential missile deployment with minimal delay between volleys.
lore: >-
  Velocity Ordnance Systems designed the SwiftStrike for overwhelming enemy point defense.
  By launching missiles in rapid succession with minimal delay, it saturates targeting systems
  and increases the probability of successful strikes. The trade-off is a smaller magazine
  capacity and longer reload times when the magazine is expended.
