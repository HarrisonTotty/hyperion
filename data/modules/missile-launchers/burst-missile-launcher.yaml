  Multi-tube launcher capable of firing devastating missile salvos to overwhelm enemy defenses.
lore: >-
  Tempest's Salvo Array revolutionized missile warfare by firing multiple missiles
  simultaneously in a coordinated strike pattern. Each volley unleashes three missiles
  that can saturate point defense systems. The complex loading mechanism results in
  slower reloads and reduced total capacity, but the alpha strike potential is unmatched.
