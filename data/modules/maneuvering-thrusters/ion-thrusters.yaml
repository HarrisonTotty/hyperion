  Uses a series of small ion engines to produce angular thrust with excellent energy efficiency.
lore: >-
  Ion thrusters have been the workhorse of maneuvering systems since the early
  days of spaceflight. While they don't provide the raw power of plasma systems,
  their exceptional fuel efficiency and reliability make them the preferred choice
  for long-duration missions and budget-conscious operators.
