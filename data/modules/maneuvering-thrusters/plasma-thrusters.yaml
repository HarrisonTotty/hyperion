manufacturer: "TitanCore Propulsion Systems"
desc: >-
  High-power plasma induction thrusters capable of generating large amounts of angular thrust.
lore: >-
  By expelling superheated plasma through precisely controlled magnetic fields,
  TitanCore's PT-3000 delivers four times the thrust of comparable ion systems.
  Combat pilots appreciate the rapid response times, though engineers complain
  about the power draw and frequent maintenance intervals.
