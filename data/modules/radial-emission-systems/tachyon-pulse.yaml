desc: "Emits a burst of tachyon particles that can penetrate shields and disrupt FTL systems."
lore: >-
  EPS's tachyon pulse represents cutting-edge particle physics applied to
  warfare. The exotic particle burst can penetrate energy shields and
  temporarily disable warp cores, though the technology remains experimental
  and energy-intensive.
