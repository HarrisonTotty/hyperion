  'Laser Beam':
    desc: >-
      A high-wattage laser beam capable of traversing incredibly long ranges at
      the speed of light. Deals a small amount of continuous damage at very long
      ranges.
  'Proton Phaser':
    desc: >-
      A basic proton-based directed-energy weapon that delivers a small amount
      of damage at a high velocity.
  'Synchrotron Converging Laser':
    desc: >-
      Uses the constructive interference of multiple lasers that converge into a
      single laser beam. Although this weapon has a firing delay as the lasers
      converge, this weapon is capable of dealing a massive amount of damage
      over a very long range.
