## Ship Positions

The following section specifies the various ship positions available in the game. Players may assume more than one role.

### Captain

Primarily a role-playing position, the captain of the ship has the unique ability to reassign crew members to different positions. Client implementations may want to present the captain interface with a "captain's log" for taking notes, but there is no server-side functionality associated with the captain's log.

### Communications Officer

The communications position has the ability to send and receieve messages from other ships and stations. They are responsible for:

1. Requesting position to dock/undock from a station.
2. Indicating intent to a hailing vessel.
3. Hailing other vessels.
4. Jamming communications of other vessels.
5. Commanding any fighters/bombers.

### Countermeasures Officer

The Countermeasures officer is responsible for:

1. Raising/lowering energy shields.
2. Monitoring shield strength and integrity.
3. Loading and activating anti-missle countermeasures.
4. Activating automated point-defence weapons.

This is a smaller position that is typically also chosen by someone primarily assuming another position.

### Directed-Energy Weapons Officer

Responsible for:

1. Targeting/firing directed-energy weapons.
2. Activating radial emission weapons.

Depending on the size and complexity of the ship, players may want to take on multiple weapons officer roles.

### Engineering Officer

The engineering officer role is one of the more complex roles of the ship.

1. Allocates power and cooling to different ship modules, tuning their effectiveness.
2. Repairs ship modules.
3. Monitors ship damage and energy production/capacity status.

### Helm

Helm is responsible for piloting the ship, including engaging the warp/jump drive and docking with stations.

### Kinetic Weapons Officer

Responsible for targeting, loading, and firing kinetic weapons.

Depending on the size and complexity of the ship, players may want to take on multiple weapons officer roles.

### Missile Weapons Officer

Responsible for targeting, loading, and firing missile weapons.

Depending on the size and complexity of the ship, players may want to take on multiple weapons officer roles.

### Science Officer

One of the more complex positons, the science is responsible for a multitude of actions, including:

1. Scanning other ships to determine their class, faction, and status.
2. Alerting the crew to incoming missiles and torpedos.
3. Providing navigational information such as heading and distance in support of the Helm.
